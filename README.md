## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Came across 42 school by chance, and decided to go for the Piscine.
Made it through the selection process, and am now in the 42 program working on the common core.
I have enjoyed reading tutorials on Github and Gitbook, and hope one day I can also contribute something to the community.
